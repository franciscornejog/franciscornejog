SCP stands for Secure Copy Protocol. It is a network protocol that copies data
from one remote location to another through a secure connection.

To scp into a file, you must include a source and a destination. 
```shell
scp <source> <destination>
```

In the source, you type in the path to the file you want to copy. In order to
connect to the remote device, you must know the username of that device as well
as the host of that device. Then you would add in the path to the destination 
you want your file to be in.
```shell
scp /path/to/file username@host:/path/to/destination
```

You may even require a port number as well.
```shell
scp -P 80 /path/to/file username@host:/path/to/destination
```
