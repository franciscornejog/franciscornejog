Hi, welcome to my small space on the Internet. Here I usually blog about things I’m currently learning. What I enjoy doing is programming and learning interesting tools to create interesting projects. What I’m interested in doing is taking on a co-op next summer. I’m looking for opportunities to practice my computational and creative skills as a software developer.
