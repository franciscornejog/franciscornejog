        <p>College can be an intimidating pathway for most people. In
        this post, I’ll be providing pointers on how to start off your
        semester or quarter in the best way. These are suggestions that
        has helped me immensely in my academic pursuits and I strongly
        believe that they will help you in yours.</p>
        <h2 id="plan-your-schedule">Plan your schedule</h2>
        <p>While figuring out what college courses to take, you must
        keep in mind how these classes can affect your time and your
        energy. One of the first mistakes that most people make is
        taking classes that are too much or too difficult for them to
        take, especially when some have jobs to support their education
        and lifestyle. If you’re not sure how to plan your schedule or
        decide which classes to take, that’s what counselors are
        for.</p>
        <h2 id="get-to-know-your-counselor">Get to know your
        counselor</h2>
        <p>Don’t be afraid to meet up with your counselor several times
        throughout the college year. Not only are counselors paid to
        help you plan your classes and your academic goals, they are
        there for you as a emotional resource, to listen and may provide
        you with personal advice.</p>
        <h2 id="preview-your-schedule">Preview your schedule</h2>
        <p>When finalizing your schedule, it helps to know where these
        classes are. If possible, go to your college before the semester
        starts and actually figure out the routes you need to take from
        class to class. This will help visualize how your entire
        semester will go, and whether you have enough time in between to
        rest or catch up on schoolwork.</p>
        <h2 id="grab-a-classmate">Grab a classmate</h2>
        <p>While taking a class, there’s a chance that you might miss a
        day or two due to sickness or unknown events. While you may be
        excused, it can be difficult to figure out what happened that
        day in class. On the first day of the class, make sure to
        connect with at least one classmate and ask for their contact
        information. That way, you will be able to ask for notes or
        important information that you might have missed that day. Of
        course, you could also return the favor.</p>
        <h2 id="talk-with-your-professor">Talk with your professor</h2>
        <p>Many people would be intimidated to talk with their
        professor, especially if they happen not to be doing well in
        class. Don’t be afraid to ask for help during their office
        hours, especially for upcoming quizzes and exams. Not only would
        you have an actual relationship with your professor, a bond
        could be developed that could benefit both you and the
        professor. You might even be able to ask for a letter of
        recommendation toward the end of the semester.</p>
        <h2 id="raise-your-hand">Raise your hand</h2>
        <p>Participate! As most students refuse to speak out their
        confusion in fear of looking stupid in the eyes of their peers,
        there are others that have just the same questions on their
        mind. It’s a worrying conundrum that can only be resolved if
        either the teacher calls a student out or someone is brave
        enough to ask questions. Again, I urge you to participate! Not
        only will your peers benefit from your questions, the professor
        will be able to gauge how the class is doing as a whole.</p>
        <h2 id="take-good-notes">Take good notes</h2>
        <p>There is not much I can say objectively about taking good
        notes. Some students do not even take notes and it works best
        for them. Just keep in mind of your own strengths and
        weaknesses, and figure out what kind of note taking is best for
        you. Some take notes during class while the professor is
        lecturing while others wait until after class to write down
        their impressions. While taking no notes during class may seem
        surprising, it frees up your mind to concentrate on the material
        the professor is giving you and you’ll be able to question and
        participate with the professor more often. Such interaction may
        help you recall the material more quickly than taking notes in
        class. As I’ve said before, the best way to take notes relies in
        how you perceive and absorb information in your own way.</p>
        <h2 id="form-study-groups">Form study groups</h2>
        <p>After class, it is usually best to review the material. One
        way to help enhance your learning is to form a study group. If
        you were able to grab a classmate, keep going! Talk to other
        classmates and ask them if they would like to be part of a study
        group. There is likely to be more interested students than you
        would think. Try to find a time and a place to agree on, mostly
        preferably at study rooms in a library or a coffee shop. Talking
        and sharing with others your thoughts and your notes will help
        enhance your learning overall. As an added benefit, you’ll have
        a much more enjoyable experience at your college.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>College can be one of the most rewarding and amazing
        experiences you could have in life. Don’t be afraid to explore
        your strengths and weaknesses. By following these tips, you may
        find friendship and connections in the most unlikely places. As
        always, stay true to yourself.</p>
